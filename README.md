## Information architecture

Three pillars at the top level. Everything else lives inside one of them.

```
/                              Women in Power — overview
├── /mentoring/                pillar 1
│     ├── 2026-fall/
│     └── mentorship-prompts/
├── /skilling/                 pillar 2
│     └── speaker-guide/
├── /networking/               pillar 3 — not built yet
└── /about/                    site-level, not a pillar
```

Two levels of navigation carry this:

- **Primary (masthead)** — pillars first, then About, then pillars with no page
  yet, quiet and unlinked: Mentoring, Skilling, About us, Networking (soon). It
  does not grow when a pillar gains a page: the placeholder turns into a link
  where it stands, which is what Skilling did on 28 Sep 2026.
- **Secondary (`.subnav`)** — appears on pages *inside* a pillar and lists
  that pillar's pages, labelled with the pillar name.

The cohort page, the Prompt Pack and the speaker guide sit inside a pillar, so
they belong in a sub-nav, not the masthead. Four items is the ceiling up there:
three pillars and About.

Pillars without pages render as `.nav-soon` spans, not links — a nav item that
404s is worse than one that admits it is not ready. They sit *after* the real
links and stay visually quiet: a placeholder must never outrank a page someone
can actually open.

### Adding the Networking pillar

Skilling went through this on 28 Sep 2026; Networking is the one still to come.

1. Create `networking/index.html` from `skilling/index.html` — the closest
   thing to a template, and already at one level of depth.
2. In **every** page's masthead, swap the `<span class="nav-soon">Networking…`
   for a real link at the right relative depth. It goes where the placeholder
   stood.
3. Add a `.subnav` once the pillar has a second page, labelled with the pillar
   name.
4. Add a line to every footer nav, update the pillar card on the overview page,
   and update the table above.

Section 02 of the style guide has the same rules with examples.

## How this is built

Plain HTML and one shared stylesheet. No build step, no dependencies — edit a
file, commit, and GitHub Pages publishes it.

```
├── assets/
│   ├── css/wip.css        ← design tokens + components. Single source of truth.
│   ├── js/wip.js          ← theme, back-to-top, journey explorer, roster
│   ├── data/people.json   ← the community roll. Names live ONLY here.
│   └── img/               ← logos, people, event photos, QR codes
│       └── qr/            ← codes for the site URL. No page uses them: they
│                            are for slides, print and conference handouts.
├── style-guide/           ← documents and previews everything in wip.css
├── index.html             ← Women in Power overview (site root)
├── mentoring/
│   ├── 2026-fall/
│   ├── 2026-cohort2/      ← meta-refresh stub only; the cohort page moved
│   └── mentorship-prompts/
└── skilling/
    └── speaker-guide/
```

### Light and dark

Every page ships in both, following the reader's device by default with a
toggle in the masthead to override. Colours are defined once on bare `:root`
and only *redefined* for dark — in a `prefers-color-scheme` block and again
under `[data-theme="dark"]` so the toggle wins either way. Never give a color
its only definition inside a media query. Section 05 of the style guide has
the full rule and the list of which tokens are themed.

Use `--heading` for headings (not `--win-navy`) and `--accent` for eyebrows and
markers, or they will vanish in dark mode.

### The journey explorer

The interactive walkthrough reads its content from the plain
`<ol class="timeline">` lists already in the markup, so there is one copy of the
words. With JavaScript off — and on paper — those lists simply render in full.
To add a journey, add a `.je-journey` block; no JavaScript changes.

It is used on two pages now: the cohort page, with four journeys behind a pair
of segmented controls, and the speaker guide, with a single six-step sequence
and no controls at all. For one journey, leave `.je-controls` out and set
`data-tier` and `data-role` on the `.journey-explorer` to match the one
`.je-journey`; they are only a lookup key and can name anything. Two more
things bit us the first time round: a step renders the **first** `.tl-body` it
finds, so a step with two paragraphs needs `.tl-body` to be a `<div>` wrapping
them; and the "show everything" button takes its wording from
`data-label-closed` / `data-label-open`, falling back to the cohort page's
"Show all four journeys as a list", which is wrong anywhere else.

### Making a change

1. **Color, type, spacing, radius** live as CSS custom properties in `:root`
   at the top of `assets/css/wip.css`. Change the token, not the page.
   If you're about to type a hex value into a page, add a token instead.
2. **Page-specific CSS** stays in that page's `<style>` block. Promote it into
   `wip.css` only when a second page needs it.
3. **New component?** Add it to the style guide in the same pull request, or
   the next person will reinvent it.
4. Bump the version and add a change-log row in `style-guide/index.html`.

### Checking a change locally

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/mentoring/2026-fall/`.

Before merging, check: 320px width, 200% browser zoom, keyboard tab order,
**both light and dark**, and print preview (people print the cohort calendar).

## Audiences

`index.html`, `mentoring/**` and `skilling/**` are **member-facing** — mentors and mentees. `style-guide/`
is **maintainers only**: it is `noindex`ed and must stay unlinked from every
member page. Don't add it to a member masthead or footer.

It is still served by Pages, so treat it as publicly reachable by anyone with
the URL — it holds design and voice guidance, nothing sensitive.

## What never goes on member pages

Committee staffing, participant counts, coverage gaps, unconfirmed decisions
and anything said in a leadership channel stay off them.

## Testimonials

The "In their words" block on `mentoring/index.html` is **commented out and
empty on purpose**. Attributed quotes must be real and used with the speaker's
permission — never write filler to fill the space. Cohort feedback forms and
the LinkedIn testimonial posts are the source. Uncomment the block once you
have three you can attribute, and ask each speaker before publishing her name.

## People, and consent

`/about/` has two very different lists.

**Leadership** is hand-written in `about/index.html` — roughly 15 people is the
ceiling before a grid of cards becomes a wall; group them by area past that.
Photos are drop-in: `data-photo="first-last.jpg"` on the avatar plus a file in
`assets/img/people/`. `wip.js` preloads and only inserts the image once it has
loaded, so a missing photo falls back to initials rather than a broken image.
See `assets/img/people/README.md`.

**The community roll** is data — `assets/data/people.json`, rendered with search
and role filters, tested at 1,000 names. Never write those names into HTML.

Two rules that are not negotiable:

1. **Nobody is listed without agreeing to it.** Being named and having your
   photo published are separate permissions. Ask for both. The final feedback
   form is the natural place.
2. **Never take a photo from LinkedIn or conference photography.** The
   photographer holds the copyright, and LinkedIn's terms prohibit it. Use the
   image the person gives you.

Leadership roles on the page came from the Feb 2026 planning assignments, which
the source document notes have **not** been re-confirmed for FY27. Validate
before treating the page as authoritative.

## The Skilling pages

`skilling/` is the member-facing cut of two internal documents: the Skilling
Committee's 2026 progress-and-plan dashboard and the speaker guide. The long
comment at the top of `skilling/index.html` lists what was deliberately left
off, and why. The short version:

- **No attendance numbers.** A page that advertises how few people came to a
  session is an argument against attending it.
- **No bench list.** Nobody should learn from a web page that they were the
  backup.
- **No open decisions**, no unscheduled-talk counts, no speaker contact details.
- **No speaker names for a session that has not been announced.** The series
  promises a speaker that her name goes out only once she has confirmed, and the
  page has to keep that promise. Themes are the committee's own framing, so they
  are safe; the line-up is not.
- **No per-speaker "first-time speaker" flag.** The aggregate share is a good
  number to publish. Labelling a named woman as inexperienced next to her own
  talk is not.

Two parts of that page are **dated** and will go stale: the fall plan under
"What's on" and the December advent calendar. Replace them with the next season
rather than leaving them up. The session list under "This season" is the public
archive — add a row once a session has run, and only for sessions that were
publicly announced.

The speaker guide has no contact email: the source document has a placeholder
where one should be. Every "contact us" on the page points at LinkedIn instead.
When there is an address to publish, put it in the FAQ only, not in six places.

## The PPCC 2026 page

`ppcc-2026/` is a time-boxed campaign page, deliberately at the root rather
than under a pillar: the URL goes on QR codes, slides and LinkedIn posts, so it
is kept short and stable.

An announcement bar links to it from every member page. **When the event is
over**, move the page under `networking/` and leave a one-line meta-refresh
stub at `ppcc-2026/index.html` — the old URL will be on printed material that
cannot be recalled. Delete the `.announce` block from each page at the same
time.

The hero photo is a drop-in: put `ppcc-2025-group.jpg` in `assets/img/ppcc/`
and it appears behind the headline and un-hides the "Last year" section. The
hero is designed to look finished without it. See that folder's README for
specs and for the consent rules on publishing photos of people.
